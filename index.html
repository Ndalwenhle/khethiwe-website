        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Khethiwe Cele, a girl from a village called KwaNguza. I come from a big family, and I completed my lower and higher grades there. I furthered my studies at UKZN where I did a BSc degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics, followed by a BSc Honours in Physics. In my first year, I was in the top 15% of my class, which earned me membership in the Golden Key International Honour Society. I also had the opportunity to tutor first-year physics students and demonstrate practicals.</p>
        <p>My journey continued with the NITheCS Internship Programme and an Honours project that allowed me to do oral presentations. I am now finishing my Master's degree at the University of Johannesburg, having submitted my draft thesis and waiting for feedback from reviewers.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love cooking, watching movies, and playing games. My dream is to become a research scientist, and despite financial difficulties during my studies, I am determined to achieve this goal.</p>
